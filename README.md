# Statamic Section Tabs

Automatically turns your Statamic Section fieldtypes into tabs.

Inspired by [addon-section-links](https://github.com/statamic/addon-section-links) by [Statamic](https://github.com/statamic) and [Statamic Field Tamer](https://github.com/pixelfear/Statamic-Field-Tamer) by [Jason Varga](https://github.com/pixelfear).

## Installation

Place the `section_tabs` folder inside of your [Statamic](http://statamic.com) site's `_add-ons` folder.

## What It Does

Section Tabs will automatically group any fieldsets between your [Section](http://statamic.com/learn/documentation/fieldtypes/section) fieldtype and create a tabbed view of each section.

## @TODO

- Styling for smaller screens
